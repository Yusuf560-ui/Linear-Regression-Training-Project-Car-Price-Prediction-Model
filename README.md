# Linear-Regression-Training-Project-Car-Price-Prediction-Model
Predicting Car prices with a local dataset on Kaggle Using Linear Regression

## What is the objective of the project?
This is a training project. I got the dataset from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/car-price-prediction).
The goal is to apply machine learning techniques especially linear regression to build a model that predicts car prices using available features 
- symboling
- CarName
- fueltype
- aspiration
- doornumber
- carbody
- drivewheel
- and many more
to predict car price

## What I discovered while working on the project ?
Machine Learning is not just about feeding data. It's about feeding the right data in the right form. 
I learned how to apply 
- Feature scaling
- Regularisation(Lasso, Ridge and ElasticNet)
- how to prevent data leakage during preprocessing
- how to properly evaluate model using metrics like R2_SCORE

## Dataset Overview
Features descriptions are available on the notebook

## Tools & Libraries Used
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
5. Scikit-learn (for modeling)
